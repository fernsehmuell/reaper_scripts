##Installation
Copy the .lua files to your Reaper scripts directory or any other directory you like. In Reaper choose Actions/Show actions list...
Press the "Load..." button on the lower right side. Select all of the fernsehmuell_ scripts and press Open/Enter.
You can find the scripts in the action list under: Script: fernsehmuell_... Now assign Keyboardshortcuts to each script ("Add..." button)
The recommended key is the letter in () at the end of the filename.
If you have problems using the Reverse_Play_Shuttle_(J) script or renamed the background-script, then you have to edit the script and insert the new command_id. 
If you use the Forward_Play_Shuttle_(L) for the first time a "ReaScript task control" window pops up. Check the checkbox and press "New instance"
